<h1>Background</h1>
<p class="background">
  I was in the computer networking shop in the trade highschool I graduated from. We learned the basic A+ and Network+ material and dipped into some of the subjects those branched into.
  I had the opportunity to obtain the corresponding certifications yet didn't and since highschool (2005) have not used or improved my knowledge much, aside from providing basic IT to the 
  small company I currently work for. Computer technology still holds my interest, although lately much of my knowledge is used to simply translate to those without the basic understand.

<h1>Currently</h1>
<p class="current">
  I recently wondered what it would take to build a text-based browser mmorpg. I believe I found where to start, so I am currently using various online resources to learn Web Development.
  I have completed an HTML course and I am in the middle of learning CSS, although I will probably retake and revisit the HTML and still need much practice in both. Aside from taking 
  courses I am still actively defining and refining my goal, and learning more about the steps and tools it will take to get there. Creating a GitHub account seemed like it might help.
